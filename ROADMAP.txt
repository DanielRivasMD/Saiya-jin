- use simlayers & replace controllers, i.e., left-handed letter (most likely excluding vowels) => char injections; controllers => app cmds
- work annotation homogenity for Babel compatibility. idea has evolved: use `edn` with metadata as master, and `babel` to semi-autogenerate app config
- system events & alfred hotkeys will remain annotated & render by `babel`, but ignore for semi-autogeneration
- coordinate Zellij / Helix
- sync browser hotkeys
- review zellij bindings
