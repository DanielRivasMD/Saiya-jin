- use simlayers & replace controllers, i.e., left-handed letter (most likely excluding vowels) => char injections; controllers => app cmds
- work annotation homogenity for Babel compatibility. idea has evolved: use `edn` with metadata as master, and `babel` to semi-autogenerate app config
- system events & alfred hotkeys will remain annotated & render by `babel`, but ignore for semi-autogeneration
- coordinate Zellij / Helix
- sync browser hotkeys
- review zellij bindings

double rctl?
lctl => z
lopt => x
lcmd => q
rcmd => w

j => other pickers helix
k => other pickers helix

lctlcmd => helix buffers
lctlopt => zellij panes
loptcmd => zellij tabs
hyper => zellij float
joker?
tab => system

helix:
  - lsp (picker - enter, rename - n, ref - r, def - d, type - t, impl - i) => zero-mode
  - undo / redo => z-mode
  - git mod (prev / next) => z-mode
  - movement (prev, next, repeat) => x-mode
  - comment (prev / next) => x-mode
  - jumplist (save, picker, prev, next) => w-mode
  - file picker (general, buffer, modified) => rcmd
  - diagnositcs (workspace picker - shift enter, picker - enter, next - down / prev - up) => rctl
